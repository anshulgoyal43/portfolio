During my time as a Campus Ambassador at Techfest, IIT Bombay, I organized technical workshops and events, fostering a community of aspiring technologists. I hold a Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication from Banasthali Vidyapith (2017-2021), where I developed a strong foundation in technical problem-solving that continues to influence my approach to marketing technology solutions.
